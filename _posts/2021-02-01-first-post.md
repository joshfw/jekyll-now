Joshua Fawcett Weiner is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science, specializing in International Relations with a minor in comparative politics. His research is on the conditions under which leadership matters in intrastate conflict. To assess this, he is leveraging variation in government and rebel leadersâ€™ backgrounds to determine how personal characteristics, such as military experience and ideological orientation, affect civil war onset and conclusion.
